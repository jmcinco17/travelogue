        <p>Takakkaw Falls is a breathtaking waterfall located in Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada.It's apparenly among the highest waterfalls in all of Canada and easily one of the most dramatic.</p>
        <p> I went on a road trip with some friends and stopped by. I honestly dont know a lot of places here in Canada so visiting this place was a very fun experience.</p>

            <p>Baguio Botanical Garden is a lush, green sanctuary in Baguio City, Philippines. It features a variety of plants, flowers, and trees native to the Cordillera region, making it a great place for nature lovers and photographers. </p>

            <p>I came here with my family when we went back to the Philippines for vacation. This was a very interesting garden with many unique species of plants, trees, orchids, and more. Being surrounded by the greenery and flowers was a very relaxing experience although it was very hot on the day we went to. I would suggest going here when the weather is nice and chilly.</p>

            <p>Patar Beach Bolinao, Pangasinan is a  white-sand beach known for its golden sands, crystal-clear waters, and breathtaking sunsets. Located on the western coast of Luzon, this beach is a favorite getaway for those looking for a spot to relax.</p>

            <p>This picture was taken at the G Beach Resort in Bolinao Philippines. We went there to relax and enjoy one of the wonderful beaches that Philippines has to offer. I would definitely recommend this place if the other beaches in the Philppines seem busy. Watching the beach waves and the sunset was just such a beautiful view.</p>
